## Documentation

The Patroon project uses [literate programming][3]. You can read about the
specs and implementation [here][1].

## Contributing

Make sure to understand the ["Literate" tool][2] before contributing.

The source code should be edited using the `index.lit` file. Run `npm t` to test the
changes. This compiles the source code and runs the tape tests.
